Access to UKB RAP (Research Analysis Platform) requires both an account on RAP and an account on UKB AMS (Access Management System). If you already have an account on AMS, you can skip the first part of these instructions and proceed directly to the creation of your RAP account.

### To create your AMS account
1. Go to https://ams.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ams/signup to create your AMS account
2. Verify your account using the link sent to your email
3. Sign into your AMS account and fill in the following details:
   * Date of birth 
   * Gender (Note: prefer not to answer is an option)
   * Phone number (Note: add international codes. For US, it’s +1) 
   * Affiliation (‘University of Colorado Boulder’)  
   * UKB accession number
   * Up to 5 pubmed ids to your previous studies 
   * Resume / CV
4. UKB will confirm and activate your account within 10 business days
5. Ask the person in charge to add you as a collaborator on our UK Biobank project in AMS<br/>
   **NOTE:** You will be able to link your AMS and RAP accounts before completing step 5, but you will not be able to access any data on RAP until this step is complete.

### To create your RAP account
1. Go to https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/register to create your RAP account
2. Verify your account using link sent to your email 
3. When you sign in, it will prompt you to link your RAP account to your AMS account. Enter the login details for your AMS account, and it will link the two accounts.<br/>
   **NOTE:** Your AMS account must have your date of birth in the account details, or you will not be allowed to proceed with linking the accounts
